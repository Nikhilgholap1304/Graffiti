# react-emojis

> :rocket: :hamster: :tada: Render all current emojis with proper accessibility markup, on any size

[![MIT Licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/dreamyguy/react-emojis/blob/master/LICENSE)

Use **react-emojis** to output the recommended markup for accessible emojis:

```javascript
<Emoji emoji="woman-dancing"/>
```

...outputs:


```html
<span role="img" aria-label="woman dancing" class="react-emojis" style="line-height: 1;">üíÉ</span>
```

## The emojis :tada: :balloon: :unicorn:

Instead of maintaining a list of _emojis_ on this README, I decided it would be best to create a living github page, that would serve both as a way of showcase the _emojis_, the **Emoji** component and facilitate their use:

https://dreamyguy.github.io/react-emojis/

On this page you can:

- Search for _emojis_
- Copy the _emoji_ to the clipboard by clicking on your choice
- Choose what you'd like to copy to the clipboard:
    - **emoji**: The 'emoji' itself _(this is the default option)_.
    - **markup**: Accessible emoji markup.
    - **reactEmojis**: **Emoji** component markup _(based on "react-emojis" usage)_.
    - **nameUrl**: Emoji name _(the reference used by "react-emojis")_.
    - **name**: Emoji name _(CLDR formatting)_.
    - **code**: Emoji's Unicode.
    - **id**: The emoji's id, as set by unicode.org.

## Line-height

**The emoji will get `line-height: 1` by default**. You can override that behavior by:

- Setting a custom `line-height` to the class `react-emojis`, which the markup output provides out of the box.
- Passing a `lineHeight` _prop_ to the component.

The latter can be done as follows:

```javascript
<Emoji emoji="woman-dancing" lineHeight="inherit"/>
```

This will give the emoji the `line-height` _from its parent_.

> One could also pass any valid value to it, as `1.2`, `20px`, etc. There's no validity check here so make sure you pass a valid value.

## Scaling

**The emoji will inherit the font size set by the parent element**. You can override that behavior by:

- Setting a `font-size` to the class `react-emojis`, which the markup output provides out of the box.
- Passing a `size` _prop_ to the component.

The latter can be done as follows:

```javascript
<Emoji emoji="woman-dancing" size="100"/>
```

This will give the emoji `100px` _**font-size**_.

> I'll be working on passing units to the component, so one can scale the emoji in whichever way one prefers. For convenience, the default unit will remain `px` if no `sizeUnit` is passed as _prop_.

## Origin

The [emoji list](https://github.com/dreamyguy/react-emojis/blob/master/src/app/components/EmojiData.js) is based on [unicode.org](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)'s current list of named emojis under "browser" column (as of 2019-05-30).

# Using _react-emojis_ through `npm`

**react-emojis** is also [available as a package on `npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-emojis) and can be installed as a depedency with:

    npm i react-emojis --save

As with any node module, first you'll have to import it with `require`:

```javascript
var Emoji = require('react-emojis');
```

...but in a modern **React** implementation you'll be using `import`:

```javascript
import Emoji from 'react-emojis';
```

_**A note on size**. With **1719** emoji definitions, this package is by no means small..._

> `react-emojis` only worked properly as a `npm` from version `v1.0.4`. If you're reading this it's no longer a problem. :tada:

# Development

## Getting started

Clone this repo locally. You'll need to have [NodeJS][1] installed. Install all dependencies by running:

    npm i

## Run it locally

To start the app locally, run:

    npm run start

This command fires up the application on port `9900`, making it visible on http://localhost:9900. Because this app is based on [create-react-app][2], the port number should be configured on the [.env](https://github.com/dreamyguy/react-emojis/blob/master/.env#L1) file.

## Building the frontend for Production

When you're ready to build for production, run:

     npm run build

This command compiles all production-optimised resources to a folder called **build**. It's meant to be run remotely, at the environment host, at build time.
